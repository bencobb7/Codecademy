# Codecademy Python Projects Repository üêç
Welcome to my Codecademy Python Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Python projects that I've completed as part of my learning journey on Codecademy. These projects cover a range of topics and skills, demonstrating my proficiency and dedication to mastering Python programming.

# Projects Overview
Thread Shed

This project involves cleaning and analyzing transaction data from the Thread Shed, a local sewing hobby shop. The shop's outdated register system stores all transaction information in a single, unwieldy string called daily_sales.

The main tasks include:

Breaking up the daily_sales string into lists of individual transactions.
Cleaning up each transaction to extract customer names, sales amounts, and thread sold.
Calculating the total sales for the day.
Determining the quantity of each color thread sold.
To accomplish these tasks, the following steps are performed:

Inspect the structure of daily_sales and identify how each transaction and its data are stored.
Replace the artifact ;,; with another character to avoid splitting transactions.
Split daily_sales into a list of individual transactions.
Split each transaction into a list of its data points.
Clean up the data points by removing unnecessary whitespace.
Extract customer names, sales amounts, and thread sold into separate lists.
Calculate the total sales for the day.
Determine the quantity of each color thread sold by splitting multi-colored entries.
Define a function to count the occurrences of a specific color thread.
Print the count of each color thread sold.
This project provides hands-on experience in data manipulation, string operations, list handling, and basic data analysis using Python, demonstrating practical applications of programming skills in a business context.

Scrabble

This project involves processing data from a group of friends playing Scrabble using dictionaries to organize players, words, and points. The tasks include:

Building a dictionary that maps letters to their respective point values.
Creating a function to calculate the point value of a word.
Creating a dictionary that maps players to the words they've played.
Calculating the total points earned by each player in the game.
The main objectives of this project are to practice dictionary manipulation, iteration, and function creation in Python. By completing these tasks, you'll gain experience in handling structured data and performing calculations based on predefined rules, such as Scrabble point values for letters.

Additionally, the project offers opportunities for further practice and extension, such as implementing functions to add new words played by players, updating point totals dynamically, and enhancing the dictionary to handle lowercase inputs for letters. These extensions provide avenues for reinforcing Python programming concepts and improving code efficiency and functionality.

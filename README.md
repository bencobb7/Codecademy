# Codecademy Python Projects Repository üêç
Welcome to my Codecademy Python Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Python projects that I've completed as part of my learning journey on Codecademy. These projects cover a range of topics and skills, demonstrating my proficiency and dedication to mastering Python programming.

# Projects Overview
Thread Shed

This project involves cleaning and analyzing transaction data from the Thread Shed, a local sewing hobby shop. The shop's outdated register system stores all transaction information in a single, unwieldy string called daily_sales.

The main tasks include:

Breaking up the daily_sales string into lists of individual transactions.
Cleaning up each transaction to extract customer names, sales amounts, and thread sold.
Calculating the total sales for the day.
Determining the quantity of each color thread sold.
To accomplish these tasks, the following steps are performed:

Inspect the structure of daily_sales and identify how each transaction and its data are stored.
Replace the artifact ;,; with another character to avoid splitting transactions.
Split daily_sales into a list of individual transactions.
Split each transaction into a list of its data points.
Clean up the data points by removing unnecessary whitespace.
Extract customer names, sales amounts, and thread sold into separate lists.
Calculate the total sales for the day.
Determine the quantity of each color thread sold by splitting multi-colored entries.
Define a function to count the occurrences of a specific color thread.
Print the count of each color thread sold.
This project provides hands-on experience in data manipulation, string operations, list handling, and basic data analysis using Python, demonstrating practical applications of programming skills in a business context.
